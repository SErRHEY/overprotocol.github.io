## Environment

When deciding how to deploy an OverProtocol node, you are presented with two primary options: **running it on a local physical machine** or **using a cloud server**. Each approach has distinct benefits and drawbacks, influenced by factors such as your technical expertise, budget, and priorities for privacy and control.

OverProtocol recommends using a local machine to participate in the network. A censorship-resistant, decentralized network ideally should not depend on cloud providers. Operating your node on your own local hardware aligns with the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.

OverProtocol's node client can operate on various types of hardware, including personal computers, laptops, dedicated servers. While it's feasible to run the node client on your regular personal computer, using a dedicated machine specifically for your node can significantly boost its performance and enhance security.

## Requirements

Although OverProtocol does not demand extensive computing power, maintaining a continuous connection to the blockchain network is essential. The system involves frequent data transfers and continuous reading and writing operations. Therefore, using **higher-quality hardware** and ensuring a **stable internet connection** can significantly enhance the performance of the client.

### Minimum Hardware Requirements

To participate as a node in OverProtocol, the minimum hardware requirements are relatively modest. However participating in a blockchain system is input/output intensive. Therefore, **securing a solid-state drive (SSD)** is crucial for efficient data handling and quick access to blockchain records.

- CPU: Dual-core or higher
- Memory: 8GB RAM
- Storage: SSD with at least 50GB available space
- Network: 8MBit/sec download speed

### Recommended Hardware Requirements

For an optimal experience and enhanced performance, particularly for validators who require more from their systems, the following specifications are recommended:

- CPU: Fast CPU with 4 or more cores
- Memory: 16GB RAM or more
- Storage: SSD with at least 128GB available space
- Network: 25+ MBit/s bandwidth

By meeting or exceeding these recommended specifications, you can ensure that your node operates efficiently, contributes positively to the network, and minimizes the risk of downtime or performance issues.
