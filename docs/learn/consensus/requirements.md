Becoming a validator in OverProtocol requires participants to meet certain criteria to ensure the network’s security, efficiency, and decentralization. These requirements are designed to encourage responsible participation while maintaining OverProtocol's accessibility and sustainability.

## Key Requirements

### 1. Minimum Stake: 256 OVER

To join as a validator, participants must stake at least **256 OVER**, OverProtocol’s native token. This minimum staking requirement serves as a **security deposit** to deter malicious behavior and ensure validators have a vested interest in the network's stability and success.

- **Security Deposit**: The staked OVER acts as collateral, which can be penalized if a validator acts maliciously or fails to meet network obligations. Misconduct, such as double-signing or prolonged inactivity, can lead to penalties, reducing the staked amount.
- **Economic Alignment**: By staking OVER, validators demonstrate their commitment to the network, ensuring they are financially incentivized to act honestly and maintain network integrity.

### 2. Maintain High Uptime

Validators are required to maintain **maximum possible uptime** to support network reliability. Consistent availability ensures seamless block validation and enhances overall network performance.

- **Why It Matters**: High uptime minimizes disruptions and secures validators’ rewards.
- **Best Practices**: Ensure robust hardware and reliable network connectivity to avoid penalties for downtime.

## Looking Ahead

OverProtocol’s validator requirements are designed to balance accessibility with responsibility, ensuring that participants of all scales can contribute to a secure and efficient network. By meeting these criteria, validators not only help maintain the integrity of OverProtocol but also earn rewards for their active participation.
