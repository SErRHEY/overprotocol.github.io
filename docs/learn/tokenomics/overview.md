    - Staking aligns validators’ incentives with the network’s security and reliability.

2. **Transaction Fees**
    - OVER is used to pay for transaction and smart contract execution fees.
    - Fees collected are partially allocated to the DAO Treasury, contributing to long-term sustainability.

3. **Incentives and Rewards**
    - Validators and active participants are rewarded in OVER for their contributions to network security and scalability.
    - Reward mechanisms encourage consistent participation and maintain a decentralized validator set.
