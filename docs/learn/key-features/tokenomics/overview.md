## Principles of Design

The OverProtocol is dedicated to crafting a robust tokenomics framework, guided by two fundamental principles throughout its design.

Firstly, the tokenomics should enhance the **security** of the blockchain. In Proof of Stake(PoS) systems, The higher the value of tokens protecting the network, the more resilient it becomes against potential attacks. Thus, the system must provide adequate incentives to attract a substantial number of validators who secure the network with their tokens.

Second, the tokenomics should emphasize **stability**, creating a dependable environment that fosters user engagement with the asset and its underlying network. Stability boosts user confidence and equips the system to handle challenges effectively. By being less vulnerable to rapid changes, the system gains the resilience to respond to external influences and facilitate recovery.

With these principles as our guide, we meticulously develop our tokenomics strategy, covering allocation, issuance, fees, yield, and other critical elements to ensure alignment with these core tenets. Let’s delve into each of these key components in detail.

## OVER Token

The native token of OverProtocol is 'Over,' with the symbol 'OVER.' This is the primary currency required for participating in and utilizing the OverProtocol. While there are other tokens on OverProtocol, OVER is the most essential to the protocol’s operations. It facilitates transactions by covering gas fees and is crucial to network security. Users participate in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus by staking OVER, contributing to the network’s resilience and trustworthiness.
