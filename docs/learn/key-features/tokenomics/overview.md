## Principles of Design

The OverProtocol is committed to designing a robust tokenomics framework. In this context, we present three key principles that guide our approach throughout the entire course of tokenomics design.

Firstly, the tokenomics should reinforce the **security** of the blockchain. In Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, the value of tokens underpinning the network's security is of paramount importance. The greater the value of tokens safeguarding the network, the more robust it becomes against potential attacks. Therefore, the system needs to offer sufficient incentives to attract a significant number of validators, who contribute to securing the network through their tokens.

Next, tokenomics should prioritize **stability**, establishing a reliable and functional environment that encourages user interaction with both the asset and its underlying network. This stability not only boosts user confidence but also gives the system more flexibility to overcome challenges. The system should be less sensitive to rapid changes to provide the resilience needed to respond effectively to external influences, ultimately facilitating recovery.

Lastly, tokenomics must incorporate **adaptability**. Whether faced with external or internal challenges, the system may require adjustments at any time. Therefore, the system needs to possess the capability to modify its parameters. This adaptability ensures the system can maintain its security and stability under various circumstances.

Guided by these principles, we carefully develop our tokenomics strategy, which includes allocation, issuance, fees, yield, and other key elements, to ensure alignment with these fundamental tenets. Now, let's explore each of these essential components in detail.

## OVER Token

The native token of OverProtocol is 'Over,' with the symbol 'OVER.' This is the primary currency required for participating in and utilizing the OverProtocol. While there are other tokens on OverProtocol, OVER is the most essential to the protocol’s operations. It facilitates transactions by covering gas fees and is crucial to network security. Users participate in the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus by staking OVER, contributing to the network’s resilience and trustworthiness.
