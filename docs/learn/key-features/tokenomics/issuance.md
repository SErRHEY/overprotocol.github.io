40% of the total tokens, equating to 400 million OVER, will be distributed over 10 years. The issuance plan ensures that 200 million OVER is allocated as the minimum guaranteed reward, distributed in equal annual amounts to stakers. Additionally, 20 million OVER will be distributed annually even after 10 years. These rewards are distributed proportionally to validators based on their staking balance and required participation rate.

## Minimum Guaranteed Rewards

40% of the total tokens, equating to 400 million OVER, will be distributed over 10 years. The issuance plan ensures that 200 million OVER is allocated as the minimum guaranteed reward, distributed in equal annual amounts to stakers. 20 million OVER will be distributed annually even after 10 years.

| Year        | Issuance  | Issuance in OVER |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Year 1 ~ 10 | 2.0%      | 20M OVER         |
| Year 11~    | 2.0%      | 20M OVER         |

## Adjustable Rewards

The remaining 200 million OVER will be used as an adjustable reward, modulated in real-time by the system without human intervention, based on the desired staking quantity. The **actual release** of staking rewards is adjusted by the protocol's predefined [feedback mechanism](feedback.md/#the-feedback-mechanism).

This mechanism acts as a reserve system to modulate the issuance levels: it reduces actual issuance when staking rewards are sufficient, and increases actual issuance when more rewards are needed by the protocol. Decisions regarding these adjustments are made based on the current staking rate.

Importantly, this reserve system is **NOT** managed by any external entities but is instead governed by a feedback mechanism within the blockchain.

Refer to the [deposit and yield](feedback.md) page to understand the whole background of the feedback mechanism.
