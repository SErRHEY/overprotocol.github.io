Over has a supply schedule that releases 1 Billion OVER over 10 years. As we transition into the 11th year, the protocol initiates an annual minting of 15 million OVER, constituting roughly $1.5\%$ of the entire supply. This approach aims to strike a balance with careful burn mechanisms to maintain an adequate supply.

## Staking Rewards

$40\%$ of the total tokens, equating to 400 million OVER, will be distributed over 10 years. The issuance plan, designed for the first ten years, is crafted based on meticulous modeling that incrementally increases and then decreases annually, taking into account the desired number of validators. Further details are described in the [Issuance section](issuance.md).

## Over Community Access Program (OCAP)

Of the total supply, $15\%$ is initially allocated to the OCAP. OCAP facilitates the distribution of OVER in various ways, such as airdrops for early community members and contributors, as well as through liquidity provision. The goal is to make participation in OverProtocol accessible to those who share our vision. The release schedule of this supply is yet to be finalized.

## Others

The rest of the FDV, 450 Million OVER, is earmarked for distribution to 4 different entities (Core contributors, Investors, Over Technologies, Over Foundation). Refer to the table below for to see the allocation amount. Each of the percentage points indicates the proportion of allocation distribution relative to the FDV. The release schedule of this supply is yet to be finalized.
