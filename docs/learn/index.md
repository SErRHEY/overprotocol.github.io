OverProtocol is a brand new layer 1 with lightweight nodes empowering personal computers, enabling anyone to run a node on their PCs and become a validator. This is made possible by OverProtocol's layered architecture through [Ethanos](../learn/key-features/layered-architecture/ethanos), which significantly decrease the resources required for block validation.

The vision of OverProtocol is to create a blockchain-based system with high inclusivity, allowing more participants to own and utilize value within the system.

Blockchain is a system based on a cooperation mechanism that trusts the systemâ€™s operation rather than any specific entity. It becomes safer and garners more trust from participants when a variety of stakeholders, unlikely to collude, come together. **This is the fundamental reason why participation in blockchain systems needs to be open and the barriers to entry low.**

The trust established in this way plays a role in safeguarding "records." The blockchain system continuously records changing states, with its most critical and simplest use case being the ledger for transaction records. By protecting these transaction records, the system can contain and utilize various forms of value.

By creating a system that anyone can participate in and use, OverProtocol will spread the experience of owning and utilizing various forms of value to more people. Ultimately, OverProtocol seeks to transform traditional methods of owning and using value, ensuring that technology serves as a bridge rather than a barrier, thus enhancing the economic empowerment of all participants.
